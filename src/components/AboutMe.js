        <p>
            Having worked in a few different industries, I bring a new perspective to the table.  I’ve worked labor, retail, manufacturing and in a polymer laboratory.  Because of  those job’s I’ve been able to take lessons from one industry and apply them elsewhere to improve operations.   I like to take on new challenges, and learn new ways to tackle problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am new to programming, but I have finished a course through the University of Utah  working with Javascript, Node, Express, React, Mongodb, SQL and more.
